2008-01-26  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* idl_extras/nsIProxyObjectManager.idl: comment out nsProxyEvent header,

	needed are three #defines.

	* Makefile: Minor changes to normalize calls

	* Remove unused idl's, for now, to keep it nice
	and clean. It's possible that they're going to be
	needed later on, I'll add them then.
	* Add another extra include not available as an idl
	file - to use the nsAppShell object.

2007-06-22 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Add yet more idl's to the list. Add a few
	headers that mozilla doesn't export as idl
	but that are in the public areas (7 headers
	needed just to get a stupid reference to the
	native mozilla widget (?!?))
