	* BrowserWindow.cpp, gluezilla.h: Add more xpcom helper objects for
	  OnProgress

2008-05-20  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* BrowserWindow.cpp: Added progress and request objects from the
	  loading events. Track progress updates.
	* gluezilla.h: Hook up new loading and progress events

2008-04-18  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* gluezilla_nsIScriptContext.h, gluezilla_nsIScriptGlobalObject.h: Add
	  eof newline
	* gluezilla.h: Fix forward declaration

2008-04-18  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* gluezilla_nsIScriptContext.h, gluezilla_nsIScriptGlobalObject.h,
	  gluezilla2K5.vcproj: Javascript eval support: Added custom
	  nsIScriptContext and nsIScriptGlobalObject headers; the
	  xulrunner-sdk-provided ones are not frozen, not idl-generated, and
	  pull in the entire private mozilla dependencies that we can't use,
	  when what I really need is just the first call from each header
	  anyway.
	* BrowserWindow.cpp: Fix status change callback
	* Widget.cpp, Widget.h: Added EvalScript for javascript eval support.
	  Code cleanup.
	* gluezilla.cpp: Added gluezilla_evalScript for javascript eval
	  support. Code cleanup.
	* interfaces.h: New headers included for javascript eval support
	* gluezilla.h: Added gluezilla_evalScript for javascript eval support.
	  Change OnStatusChange signature to use unicode strings.

2008-04-07  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* gluezilla.cpp, gluezilla.h: Use gluezilla_init for platform initialization
	code only, browser widget initialization code moved to createBrowserWindow.
	Fixes support of more than one embedded browser instance.

2008-03-27  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gluezilla.cpp, gluezilla.h: Debug helper method change
	* Widget.cpp: Only resize the gtk widget if we're running on a platform
	that needs it.

2008-03-04  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gluezilla.*: fix getServiceManager to return the object directly.

2008-03-02  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* interfaces.h: Seems xulrunner 1.9 removed some headers with defines
	that I was using to detect what type of toolkit it was running on. Removed
	the offending header from the include list, and rely on OS defines only 
	(*sigh*)

	* gluezilla.h: Clean out a bunch of events that are not being used. Change
	the OS detection defines. Added new managed string support, soon to replace
	old string methods.

	* gluezilla.cpp, Widget.*: Change OS detection defines. Fix platform detection
	code so it runs happily in gtk apps as well.

	* EventListener.cpp: Send the event-affected node up to the managed side so
	it can be matched it to a managed object and fired properly.

2008-01-30  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* windows.mak: add local directory for includes.
	* BrowserWindow.cpp: allocate event name differently, msvc doesn't
	like the old way.
	* Widget.cpp: only activate and deactivate browser on non-windows
	systems, windows doesn't like it.

2008-01-28  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* windows.mak: Updated with new EventListener files

2008-01-28  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* EventListener.cpp, EventListener.h: Forgot to add them :p

2008-01-28  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* EventListener.*: Move event handlers out of BrowserWindow and into
	a separate handler class. This class calls events directly (does not
	go through Widget, which was a pointless call anyway). Add focus. blur,
	load and unload handlers.

	* BrowserWindow.*: Relay events to the EventListener class, and save
	instances on a list for later release.
	Use nsIEmbeddingSiteWindow2 interface to get blur events.
	Fire Status text change events.

	* Widget.*: Call Activate() on focus, and Deactivate() on blur. 
	According to the docs, it should only be called if the browser is shown, 
	but focus doesn't work correctly without it.
	Remove Event* methods that are not needed anymore (events are called
	directly through EventListener)

	* Makefile.am: Added new classes (and a missing header).

	* interfaces.h: move print macros to here

	* gluezilla.h: Add Load and Unload, rearrange callbacks

2008-01-26  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Widget.cpp: Add proxy defines in case we're building against a local 
	xulrunner in build/ (see ChangeLog in build/)

2008-01-24  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BrowserWindow.cpp (OnStateChange): send progress events up

2008-01-18  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Widget.cpp: don't cache navigation and document objects.

2008-01-18  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gluezilla.cpp, gluezilla.h, Widget.h: add platform support
	* BrowserWindow.cpp, interfaces.h: Use specific widget define instead
	of generic os define to detect gtk

2008-01-10  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: include *.manifest in EXTRA_DIST

2008-01-10  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gluezilla.dll.nonsp1.manifest, gluezilla.dll.nonsp1.debug.manifest:
	custom manifests that reference the original (non sp1) crt so that
	gluezilla can run on un-updated XPs even if compiled with an SP1
	platform SDK.
	
	* windows.mak: Ignore the generated manifest file, and use our own
	manifest files instead.
	
2008-01-06  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Widget.h, Widget.cpp, gluezilla.h, gluezilla.cpp: Add method to get
	proxies for any object. It's not enough to use proxies for the top
	document object, as any other object retrieved through it with xpcom
	will not come proxied.

	Note: interface marshalling will addref objects asap, which happens 
	before we can proxy them properly, so the addrefs and releases will
	happen on the wrong thread. Things only go wrong if the object is
	manipulated on the wrong thread and if that forces a gui update, 
	though, so it's not (too) bad.

2008-01-04  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Widget.cpp: fix calls between threads, now that we can actually
	go through this from different places.

2007-12-25  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>
	
	* Wrap mozilla dom objects around proxies to allow winforms to call 
	methods	accross threads (from the winforms ui thread to the main 
	mozilla ui thread).

2007-11-19  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: include windows.mak in EXTRA_DIST

2007-11-18  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* windows.mak: embed manifest file in a release build so windows 
	actually loads dependencies correctly

2007-11-09  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BrowserWindow.cpp: Disable event calls on OnStateChange, it's unstable

2007-11-08  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BrowserWindow.cpp: When loading, invoke events on the managed side
	so it can track progress and url changes.
	* gluezilla.h, Widget.h: remove unneeded events, fix parameters.
	* interfaces.h: add nsIURI interface, OnLocationChanged needs it
	* Widget.cpp: add StateChange and LocationChange implementations to
	call up to the managed side.

2007-11-06  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* windows.mak: windows makefile for command line building with nmake
	* gluezilla2k5.vcproj: add release configuration, finetune settings

2007-11-06  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Disable debug messages when enable-optimize=yes (non-debug build)
	* gluezilla.*: add access to the WebNavigation object, for future 
			direct interface access

2007-11-05  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* LocationProvider.*, Widget.cpp: GRE_GetXPComPath() searches for a 
	runtime with a fixed version equal to the one it was built against,
	so only use it to search for a local runtime, and if it fails, use
	GRE_GetPathWithProperties() to get a runtime with a version >= 1.8,
	independently of whatever version it was initially built with.

2007-10-31  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gluezilla.*,Widget.h: Receive user data dir to store local data.
	* LocationProvider.cpp: Use the user data dir for component and xpti
	registry. Use the mozilla directories to load plugins and other shared
	mozilla things. No need to use local directories anymore.

2007-10-30  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gluezilla.*, Widget.*: add blur entry point to catch
	when the webbrowser control loses focus

2007-10-18  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add missing headers to EXTRA_DIST

2007-10-18  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Widget.cpp: fix pointer cast for 64-bit arch, fix asynch 
	return value

2007-10-07  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Implement helper methods for the nsString class, to 
	initialize/destroy nsString instances and get/set the actual
	chars.
	All dom interface methods that have string parameters
	take a nsString class, which comes from these helper
	methods.
	Change the exit to really quit the gtk thread.
	Add dom interface support.

2007-09-23  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Implement dialog popups through the custom 
	PromptService - alert, alertcheck, confirm,
	confirmcheck, confirmex, prompt, promptpassword,
	promptusernameandpassword, select
	Fix event naming.
	BrowserWindow is now an interface, don't know if
	that is to keep.

2007-09-13  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* add enumeration to control focus
	* remove blur method (not needed)
	* fix bad parameter on gtk_shutdown

2007-09-12  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* GtkWidget.cpp: Fix keyboard handling
	* Widget.*, xulbrowser.*: 
		- setup shutdown routines
		- do a bit more logging, prepare for non-debug builds

Mon Aug 20 19:45:18 CEST 2007 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* Widget.cpp: set the parent earlier in CreateBrowserWindow ().

2007-08-09 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* LocationProvider.*: Custom directory service
	implementation to control where profiles, defaults
	and components are loaded, and where the component
	registry is saved. This is so that components can
	be loaded from the xulrunner lib path but the 
	registry is saved to the application dir.
	
	Saving and loading profiles from the application
	dir also enables https, since it needs to save 
	and load	the cert.db and similar files somewhere 
	or else https is not initialized 
	(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309877)
	
	* BrowserWindow.*: Navigation control. Page reloading.
	
	* Widget.*: Custom GRE startup to use the custom
	directory service provider (LocationProvider) instead
	of the default provider.
	Implement more events.
	
	* xulbrowser.*: Initialize library with application
	dir (might come in handy later). Navigation control
	

2007-07-30 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Implement custom prompt and security dialog service
	  components.
	  Implement mouse, key and focus handlers and callbacks.
	  Implement Focus and Activation management.
	  Setup generic event callback (for monitoring)
	  Separate ns* interface includes

2007-07-21 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>
	
	* Implement IEmbeddedSiteWindow for sizing and title
	support. Implement resizing. Normalize width and height.
	Fix casts.
	Add vstudio 2005 project

2007-07-05 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Clean up/reduce ifdef clutter/remove duplicate code 
	on the gtk-related portions by invoking a "delegate" 
	to call methods on the widget - the delegates handle 
	the gtk stuff generically so things are nice and 
	shiny and non-duplicated all over the place.
	
2007-07-04 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Fix the navigate method; use the embedded string api
	through nsEmbedString; add an empty debug call just to
	force load the library and to make it easier to debug

2007-07-04 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BrowserWindow.cpp, BrowserWindow.h, xulbrowser.h: 
	Change the include paths of non-frozen interfaces to use
	the xulrunner-devel package tree.

2007-06-25 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BrowserWindow.cpp: 
	- Apart from a few changes in variable 
	naming (out with the prefixes, eek), add initializations 
	for session history and window creator. 
	- When on gtk, get the native	mozilla widget that is the 
	real drawing surface (not used for now, might come in handy
	later).
	- Save the current uri in the object so it can be	reloaded 
	later (overload to the Navigate method).
	- Add a lot of debug printlines (gtk only).
	- Add implementation of nsIWindowCreator's CreateChromeWindow 
	(this is gtk only as far as I can tell, windows does not 
	need this, and xlib toolkit probably doesn't, either).

	* BrowserWindow.h: normalize includes and variable naming, 
	add extra Navigate overload and uri 
	getters/setters.
	
	* gtkWidget.cpp/h: Inherit it from window so it can be
	self-suficient. Add a new window signal (not used yet).
	Add a new constructor so it can also use a normal gtk window
	as parent instead of a XID.
	
	* Widget.cpp/h: Add initialization of AppShell. This is 
	absolutely required for the browser widget to work on 
	linux, and is not mentioned *anywhere*. <grrrr>
	Add thread support on linux/gtk (this gtk widget code
	should go somewhere else...)
	
	* xulbrowser.cpp/h: Add thread to run the gtk main loop, 
	and reroute all requests on linux/gtk to that thread so 
	that things actually *work*.
	New params class to help pass parameters to the gtk gui
	thread.
	
2007-06-22 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* gtkWidget.cpp, gtkWidget.h: a custom gtk widget
	to feed to mozilla (just on linux). It takes
	a native window handle on construction, so
	it bootstraps onto an existing X window instead
	of requiring a top level gtk window.
	
	* Change browser init sequence on linux to call
	the gtk_main loop, catch the expose event on the
	widget and create the browser there, raising
	an OnWidgetLoaded event when done. On Windows, do
	everything normal but also raise the OnWidgetLoaded
	event.
	The OnWidgetLoaded signals that initialization is done.
	Start catching events on the browser (at least on windows,
	still no luck getting it to show up on linux)

2007-06-18	Andreia Gaita	<avidigal@novell.com>

	* initial checkin.
